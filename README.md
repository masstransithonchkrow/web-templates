# Web Templates for 365stops.ORG
<hr />
<h3>What's this page for?</h3> <br />
This page hosts the template data for all stories and DeskThemePack 'hardlink' pages on my site. If a hardlink does not exist, a 'softlink' to another site's page will be maintained until a hard link is created.<br />
<h3>When should we see updates to this?</h3><br />
Updates are made if the style or syntax is substantially changed.
<h3>What's so special about these templates?</h3> <br />
I have made them printer-friendly. Story pages will show the drop characters during the print process. The drop characters are treated by the browser as background images, and do not show normally. If a user wishes to print content from my site, they shouldn't be forced to use a lot of ink. The left-facing headers will not print.
In addition, the width of the page is increased to 90% or more to utilize available page space.<br />
<h3>What are the color schemes for your site? I noticed two different ones.</h3><br />
Glad you asked. My website's source is completely viewable because I've ignored my WordPress plugin. Check out 365stops.css and 365stops-nite.css and see for yourself. First comment available.<br />
<h3>These ideas can't possibly be yours.</h3><br />
You'd be right. In those same CSS files, I try to include a link to sites where I got the ideas from so others can create solutions for themselves.<br />
